========================================

Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin only crashes on edge cases
[ ] - Handin uses provided collision debugger


Primary Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin meets all global requirements
[ ] - Analytic ellipsoid raycasting (ray-sphere intersection)
[ ] - Analytic triangle raycasting (ray-plane intersection)
[ ] - Analytic ellipsoid-triangle collision detection
    [ ] - Ellipsoid-triangle collision
    [ ] - Ellipsoid-edge collision
    [ ] - Ellipsoid-vertex collision
    [ ] - All collision tests return the correct parametric t value
[ ] - Debugger draws the ellipsoid at its location at the time of collision


Global requirements
========================================
[ ] - Qt project (.pro) file included
[ ] - All files generated by build are removed (build-* folder, *.o files within the project directory)
[ ] - README
[ ] - has a copy of the rubric
[ ] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
[ ] - documents known bugs
[ ] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[ ] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[ ] - No external dependencies
[ ] - Engine and game in separate packages
[ ] - Engine and game logically separated
[ ] - Engine and game code isn't horribly designed
    [ ] - No game logic is handled outside of the game world
    [ ] - Most game logic is contained within behaviors
    [ ] - GameObjects do not gain any functionality from inheritance
    [ ] - Behaviors are extensible - no hardcoding required to add new behaviors
    [ ] - Systems are extensible - minimal hardcoding required to add new systems
[ ] - Handin runs on department machines
[ ] - Handin works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] - Handin runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout






Known Issues:
  - Ellipsoid triangle collision is a bit off. Works for spheres so space conversion must be wrong.
Hours: 2.5

Everything implemented in /collision
