Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin only crashes on edge cases
[ ] - All Minecraft3 primary game requirements must be met


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin meets all global requirements
[ ] - UI
        [ ] - Support for orthographic UI within your engine
        [ ] - Support for HUDs within your engine
        [ ] - Support for basic out of game UI within your engine. Might include implementations for basic UI elements such as
                [ ] - Buttons
                [ ] - Text boxes
                [ ] - Containers


Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] - All playtesting requirements are satisfied
[ ] - Your game makes use of
	[ ] - Orthographic UI
	[ ] - HUDs
	[ ] - Out of game UI


Secondary Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Primary game requirements are satisfied
[ ] - Choose one or more of
	[ ] - Sound
	[ ] - Chunk persistence (savingi changes made to chunks)
	[ ] - At least 3 different types of enemies that behave distinctly from one another
	[ ] - More interesting procedural terrain. Examples include
		[ ] - Using more complex noise (e.g. 3D noise)
		[ ] - Making use of value noise to generate more interesting features in your terrain (e.g biomes).
	[ ] - Something else (run it by the TAs first!)


Global requirements
========================================
[ ] - Qt project (.pro) file included
[ ] - All files generated by build are removed (build-* folder, *.o files within the project directory)
[ ] - README
        [ ] - has a copy of the rubric
        [ ] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
        [ ] - documents known bugs
        [ ] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[ ] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[ ] - No external dependencies
[ ] - Engine and game in separate packages
[ ] - Engine and game logically separated
[ ] - Engine and game code isn't horribly designed
        [ ] - No game logic is handled outside of the game world
        [ ] - Most game logic is contained within behaviors
        [ ] - GameObjects do not gain any functionality from inheritance
        [ ] - Behaviors are extensible - no hardcoding required to add new behaviors
        [ ] - Systems are extensible - minimal hardcoding required to add new systems
[ ] - Handin runs on department machines
[ ] - Handin works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] - Handin runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout








Known Issues:
  - Can place blocks in enemies. Enemies don't have collision response.
  - Might still be possible to place blocks to clip out of bounds. 3rd person camera
  can certainly clip out of bounds.
	- Can get into world before it has loaded on the menu.

Hours: 6


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
 - UI
         - Support for orthographic UI within your engine
         - Support for HUDs within your engine
         - Support for basic out of game UI within your engine. Might include implementations for basic UI elements such as
                 - Buttons
                 - Text boxes
                 - Containers

   Yep. There is a UIComponent which both HUDComponent and OrthographicUIComponent inherit from.
	 These are controlled in the GraphicsSystem and are drawn after the regular GraphicsComponents
	 There are also simplistic Button and HUDText components

Primary Game Requirements
========================================
 - Your game makes use of
	 - Orthographic UI
	 - HUDs
	 - Out of game UI

	 Yes to all. The game has a simplistic NPCText, HealthBar and MenuButton in order


Secondary Requirements
========================================
	 - Sound

	 Sound is in the engine and works but qt on the dept. machines don't have multimedia.
	 Tried to compile multimedia and include but ran out of time.
