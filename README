========================================

Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin only crashes on edge cases
[ ] - All Minecraft2 primary game requirements must be met


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin meets all global requirements
[ ] - VoxelSystem
[ ] - Analytic voxel-based raycasting
[ ] - Addition and removal of block methods
[ ] - Addition or removal of blocks updates the Chunk’s shape


Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] - All playtesting requirements are satisfied
[ ] - Addition and removal of blocks
	[ ] - Ray shot from the camera eye extending along the look vector
[ ] - Visual highlighting of the nearest intersected face
	[ ] - Targeted block can be removed
	[ ] - Block can be added to the empty block adjacent to the targeted face


Secondary Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin meets all primary engin requirements
[ ] - VoxelSystem
	[ ] - Automated chunk streaming
		[ ] - Chunks within a certain distance of a selected focus point are automatically loaded (created)
		[ ] - Loaded chunks outside a certain distance are unloaded (deleted) from the World


Secondary Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Primary game requirements are satisfied
[ ] - Game must incorporate chunk streaming
[ ] - Simplistic enemies
[ ] - Spawn either at the beginning of the game or at intervals during play
	[ ] - Collide and interact with both the world and the player
	[ ] - No complex AI required, but cannot remain stationary or jump in place
[ ] - It must be possible to restart the game without quitting the program
[ ] - The game must have at least two screens


Global requirements
========================================
[ ] - Qt project (.pro) file included
[ ] - All files generated by build are removed (build-* folder, *.o files within the project directory)
[ ] - README
    [ ] - has a copy of the rubric
    [ ] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
    [ ] - documents known bugs
    [ ] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[ ] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[ ] - No external dependencies
[ ] - Engine and game in separate packages
[ ] - Engine and game logically separated
[ ] - Engine and game code isn't horribly designed
[ ] - Handin runs on department machines
[ ] - Handin works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] - Handin runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout










Known Issues:
  - Can place blocks in enemies. Enemies don't have collision response.
  - Might still be possible to place blocks to clip out of bounds. 3rd person camera
  can certainly clip out of bounds.

Hours: 11


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
 - VoxelSystem
 - Analytic voxel-based raycasting
 - Addition and removal of block methods
 - Addition or removal of blocks updates the Chunk’s shape

  Yes - everything in ChunkManager. ChunkManager is now engine side also.


Primary Game Requirements
========================================
 - Addition and removal of blocks
	 - Ray shot from the camera eye extending along the look vector
 - Visual highlighting of the nearest intersected face
	 - Targeted block can be removed
	 - Block can be added to the empty block adjacent to the targeted face

   Yep. Right and left click. Logic in PlayerMoveComponent.

    Yes. See ChunkManager.

  Yes to all. Enemies have bugs listed above but do collide and interact with the world and player.
