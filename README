Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin only crashes on edge cases
[ ] - Your game renders a quad in 3D
[ ] - Moving the mouse pans the camera
[ ] - Pressing certain keys moves the camera


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin meets all global requirements
[ ] - Screen management
        [ ] - Virtual Screen class representing a logical subscreen of a game which (minimally) supports:
                [ ] - Timed updates (tick)
                [ ] - Render events (draw)
                [ ] - Input events (mouse and keyboard)
                [ ] - Window size updates (resize)
        [ ] - Virtual Application class representing a whole game which supports:
                [ ] - Timed updates (tick)
                [ ] - Render events (draw)
                [ ] - Input events (mouse and keyboard)
                [ ] - Window size updates (resize)
                [ ] - Adding and removing screens
                [ ] - Switching screens
[ ] - Your engine uses the provided Camera object, or you’ve built your own Camera object
[ ] - Your engine uses the provided Graphics object, or you’ve built your own Graphics object


Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Ground must consist of planar geometry with a grass texture
[ ] - The player must be able to move using standard first person camera controls, meaning:
[ ] - Horizontal mouse movements change the yaw of the camera
        [ ] - Vertical mouse movements change the pitch of the camera
        [ ] - Standard WASD keyboard controls (W moves forwards, S moves backwards, A strafes left, D strafes right) change the eye of the camera


Secondary Game Requirements
======================================
[ ] - Handin meets all primary game requirements
[ ] - The player must never fall through the ground at y = 0
[ ] - The player must be able to jump off the ground using the spacebar or a mouse button
[ ] - Gravity must act downwards on the player
[ ] - The player can only jump when on the ground
[ ] - The game must have at least two screens, one of which requires player input to get to the other
[ ] - The ground must consist of planar geometry with a tiled grass texture


Global Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[ ] - Qt project (.pro) file
[ ] - All files generated by build are removed (build-* folder, *.o files within the project directory)
[ ] - README
    [ ] - has a copy of the rubric
    [ ] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
    [ ] - documents known bugs
    [ ] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[ ] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[ ] - No external dependencies
[ ] - Engine and game in separate packages
[ ] - Engine and game logically separated
[ ] - Handin runs on department machines
[ ] - Handin works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] - Handin runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout
