Common Engine Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] Able to load OBJ models using the support code
		[ ] Able to render OBJ models using the support code
		[ ] Stores only one copy of any single model (never load the same model twice)

Geometric Engine Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] All raycasting and collision detection requirements from Platformer1 are fulfilled
		[ ] Analytic collision response
			[ ] Collision response slides for at least N iterations of the sweep test in the plane horizontal to collision (N = 4 is a good value)
			[ ] Collision routines return a struct containing the contact point and normal

	Secondary Requirements
	---------------------
    	[ ] At least one hack from the lecture slides is implemented and documented in code

Game Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
