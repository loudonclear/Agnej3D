COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE

Retries used: NONE (5 retries left)

[ ] Completed a design check
[ ] Participated in playtesting

Geometric Engine Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] Pathfinding and navigation across a loaded navigation mesh
			[ ] Construct a graph from a navigation mesh loaded from an OBJ file
			[ ] Query for the polygon in the mesh directly under a point
			[ ] Search through the graph for a path between two points (feel free to use BFS)
			[ ] Some form of path generation - ex. midpoint of portals

	Secondary Requirements
	----------------------
		[ ] Path generation using the simple stupid funnel algorithm

Game Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	-------------------
		[ ] The game must follow all primary requirements from platformer2
		[ ] The player must be able to toggle a visualization of navigation using a key input
			[ ] The visualization must render the navigation mesh
			[ ] The visualization must render the shortest path from the current player position to a target point
			[ ] The target point must be visualized by an ellipsoid (it does not have to collide)
			[ ] The player must be able to change the target point by raycasting the environment (place the center at the result)
			[ ] The player must be able to change the target point by raycasting the target point (place the center at the result)

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout
