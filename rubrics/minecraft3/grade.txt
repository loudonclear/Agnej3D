Voxel Engine Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] Analytic voxel-based raycasting
		[ ] Addition and removal of block methods 
			[ ] Addition or removal of blocks updates the appropriate VBO's

	Secondary Requirements
	----------------------
		[ ] Automated chunk streaming 
			[ ] Chunks within a certain distance of a selected focus point are automatically loaded into the game
			[ ] Loaded chunks outside a certain distance are unloaded from the game

Game Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] Addition and removal of blocks
			[ ] Ray shot from the camera eye extending along the look vector
			[ ] Visual highlighting of the nearest intersected face
			[ ] Targeted block can be removed
			[ ] Block can be added to the empty block adjacent to the targeted face

	Secondary Requirements
	----------------------
		[ ] Continuous chunk streaming
			[ ] Chunks within 2 chunks of the player must be in memory
			[ ] Chunks further than this distance must be unloaded from memory (you do not need to save changes to unloaded chunks)
			[ ] Initialization of newly visible chunks must be spread across multiple frames or performed in a separate thread

	Tertiary Requirements
	---------------------
		[ ] Simplistic enemies
			[ ] Spawn either at the beginning of the game or at intervals during play
			[ ] Collide and interact with both the world and the player
			[ ] No complex AI required, but cannot remain stationary or jump in place
		[ ] It must be possible to restart the game without quitting the program
		[ ] The game must have at least two screens

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout
