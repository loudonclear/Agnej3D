Voxel Engine Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] Chunk-based world representation (implemented as a "manager")
		[ ] Block defined as a 1x1x1 cube with (minimally) the following characteristics:
			[ ] Transparency - should the engine render block faces adjacent to this block?
			[ ] Passability - can entities pass through this block?
		[ ] Chunk defined as a CxCxC group of blocks, where C is a single parameter (or 3 different ones) determining chunk dimensions
	
	Secondary Requirements
	----------------------
		[ ] Chunks render only block faces that are adjacent to transparent blocks, with the exception of chunk boundaries, which may always be rendered

Game Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] Movement and view controls must the same as warmup
		[ ] The world must have no gravity, so the player must have additional controls to change their height
		[ ] The world must consist of a 2x1x2 grid of size C = 32 chunks

	Secondary Requirements
	----------------------
		[ ] The terrain in the world must be procedurally generated
			[ ] Chunk composition is algorithmically determined with the complexity of at least a sin wave
			[ ] Terrain contains at least two visually unique blocks besides air/empty blocks


Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
