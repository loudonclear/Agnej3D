[ ] Completed a design check

Common Engine Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] First person camera support 
			[ ] Yaws around the up (positive Y in OpenGL) axis
			[ ] Pitches in the horizontal plane
			[ ] Camera pitch is locked to the range (-pi/2, pi/2)
			[ ] Forward-backward and left-right strafe style movement of the eye
		[ ] Screen management
			[ ] Virtual Screen class representing a logical subscreen of a game which (minimally) supports:
				[ ] Timed updates (tick)
				[ ] Render events (draw)
				[ ] Input events (mouse and keyboard)
				[ ] Window size updates (resize)
			[ ] Virtual Application class representing a whole game which supports custom OpenGL initialization and, minimally, a stack of Screens
		[ ] Custom Graphics object
			[ ] Supports the loading of textures from image files
			[ ] Supports the storage and binding of unique OpenGL texture IDs by a string key
			[ ] Supports the storage and drawing of shapes by a string key 
			[ ] Supports rendering a 1x1 textured quad
		    [ ] Maintains an active shader program that is used for drawing

Game Requirements
========================================
	Primary Requirements
	--------------------
		[ ] The player must be able to move using standard first person camera controls, meaning:
			[ ] Horizontal mouse movements change the yaw of the camera
			[ ] Vertical mouse movements change the pitch of the camera
			[ ] Standard WASD keyboard controls (W moves forwards, S moves backwards, A strafes left, D strafes right) change the eye of the camera

	Secondary Requirements
	----------------------
		[ ] The player must never fall through the ground at y = 0
		[ ] The player must be able to jump off the ground using the spacebar or a mouse button
		[ ] Gravity must act downwards on the player
		[ ] Ground must consist of planar geometry with a grass texture (does not have to be tiled)
		[ ] The player can only jump when on the ground

	Tertiary Requirements
	---------------------
		[ ] The game must have at least two screens, one of which requires player input to get to the other
		[ ] The ground must consist of planar geometry with a tiled grass texture


Global Requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout
